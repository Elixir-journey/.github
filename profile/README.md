  My mission is to foster a deep understanding of the Elixir ecosystem, promote learning through hands-on projects, and create tools and libraries that benefit the developer community.

## What I Do

I focus on:

- Hands-On Projects: Engaging in meaningful projects that showcase practical applications of Elixir and its ecosystem.
- Open-Source contributions: Building and maintaining open-source tools, libraries, and sample projects to empower developers.
- Distributed Systems: Experimenting with and building distributed systems, emphasizing the strengths of BEAM for concurrency and fault tolerance.

## Key Projects

Here are some of my notable public repositories:

- [Advent journey](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/advent-journey): A comprehensive collection of solutions and insights from [advent of code challenges](https://adventofcode.com). It's streamlined by a [toolkit](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/advent-toolkit) focusing on common tasks like handling I/O, parsing, and utility functions. This toolkit allows Advent Journey to concentrate on core logic without the distraction of repetitive setup tasks.
- [Bracket Labs](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/bracket-labs): An interactive LiveView application where users can craft their own March Madness brackets, powered by the [MadnessMaker HEX module](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/madness-maker) for accurate tournament data processing.
- [Dragon's tome](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/dragons-tome): Dragon's tome is an interactive, distributed text adventure that immerses readers in building a complex, multiplayer game world using Elixir and BEAM. Through world-building, gameplay mechanics, and hands-on challenges in the [Dragon' gate](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/dragons-gate) repository, readers can explore and even modify core elements of distributed systems, all while following a cohesive vision for a dynamic, adventure-driven experience.
