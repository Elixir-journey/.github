  My mission is to foster a deep understanding of the Elixir ecosystem, promote learning through hands-on projects, and create tools and libraries that benefit the developer community.

## What I Do

I focus on:

- Hands-On Projects: Engaging in meaningful projects that showcase practical applications of Elixir and its ecosystem.
- Open-Source contributions: Building and maintaining open-source tools, libraries, and sample projects to empower developers.
- Distributed Systems: Experimenting with and building distributed systems, emphasizing the strengths of BEAM for concurrency and fault tolerance.

## Key Projects

Here are some of my notable public repositories:

- [Elixir kickoff template](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/elixir-kickoff): A lightweight project template enabling developers to start building general-purpose Elixir applications/libraries as quickly as possible.
- [Dragon's tome](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/dragons-tome): Dragon's tome is an interactive, distributed text adventure that immerses readers in building a complex, multiplayer game world using Elixir and BEAM. Through world-building, gameplay mechanics, and hands-on challenges in the [Dragon' gate](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/dragons-gate) repository, readers can explore and even modify core elements of distributed systems, all while following a cohesive vision for a dynamic, adventure-driven experience.
