## What I Do

I focus on:

- Hands-On Projects: Engaging in meaningful projects that showcase practical applications of Elixir and its ecosystem.
- Open-Source contributions: Building and maintaining open-source tools, libraries, and sample projects to empower developers.
- Distributed Systems: Experimenting with and building distributed systems, emphasizing the strengths of BEAM for concurrency and fault tolerance.

## Key Projects

Here are some of my notable public repositories:

- [Advent journey](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/advent-journey): A comprehensive collection of solutions and insights into programming challenges, showcasing Elixir in action.
- [Bracket Labs](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/bracket-labs): An interactive LiveView application where users can craft their own March Madness brackets, powered by the [MadnessMaker HEX module](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/madness-maker) for accurate tournament data processing.
- [Beware of Dragons](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/dragons-tome): Dragons tome is an interactive, distributed text adventure that immerses readers in building a complex, multiplayer game world using Elixir and BEAM. Through world-building, gameplay mechanics, and hands-on challenges in the [Dragons' Gate](https://github.com/Elixir-journey/dragons-gate) repository, readers can explore and even modify core elements of distributed systems, all while following a cohesive vision for a dynamic, adventure-driven experience.
